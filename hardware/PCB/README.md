# Features

- Bluetooth
- type-c off board interface
- ws2812 RGB matrix
- hot swap switches

# What Can be Improved

- type-c sub board and battary interface too thin
- bluetooth module in bad position,it's batter to place it to the edge of board
- ws2812 package too tight,hard to put the element in
- swd download interface in bad position,better to the edge
- the on board power design is a failure, I have to use a off board one
